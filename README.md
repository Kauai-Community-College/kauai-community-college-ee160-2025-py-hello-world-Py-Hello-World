# Py-Hello-World
&emsp; Baby's first Python code...

# Task List:

### 1:
&emsp; Create a new .py file and add it to this repo!

### 2:
&emsp; In your .py file, make a comment header that gives people some information about the code. You can do this by placing a hashtag (#) at the start of each line, OR placing the multiline block of text between three single or double quotes. (''' or """) I prefer using hashtags, but if you wanted to write a small novel, you might prefer the quotes. Comment based headers were critically important for understanding code historically, and you will still see them frequently. They are becoming a little less critical now that we have dedicated tools for documenting code. (like github!) Include at least the following info: <br> <br>
&emsp; -Your full name. <br>
&emsp; -The file creation date. <br>
&emsp; -The most recent edit date. <br>
&emsp; -A short description of the purpose of the code. <br> <br>
&emsp; <i>Note: It is also fairly common for people to jazz up their comment headers with some character patterns or even ascii art... Have fun with it! I'll put a simple example below:</i> <br> <br>
&emsp; #-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-# <br>
&emsp; #  HelloWorld.py prints the text "Hello World!" to the display. <br>
&emsp; #  <br>

### 3:
&emsp; Have your script print the words "Hello World!" to the screen.

### 4:
&emsp; Profit????

### Congratulations, you are now a programmer!
